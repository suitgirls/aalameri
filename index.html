   <p> My name is Aala Al-Ameri. I am an upcoming Junior and I live in North Syracuse. I decided to take this class because I found it interesting. There were multiple things in the description of the class that I found cool such as learning about self-tracking. Specifically, I like to code. The programming language I am used to is Javascript. Outside of school I am a type of person who loves watching TV shows. Some TV shows I enjoy include Umbrella academy, Never Have I Ever, and Bridgerton. I am the oldest sibling of five. I want to go int the pre-med track specfically General surgery.
