            Maureen Baginski embarked on her cryptology career in 1979 when she assumed the role of a Russian Language instructor. Throughout her professional journey, she has honed her expertise in intelligence analysis, national security, and the intricate complexities of counterterrorism efforts. Notably, she made history by becoming the first individual to serve as the FBI Executive Assistant Director of Intelligence, where she played a pivotal role in developing and managing the FBI's intelligence program. Furthermore, she also made significant contributions to the National Security Agency (NSA), further solidifying her reputation as a distinguished figure in the field of intelligence and national security.

            During the terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001, Ms. Baginski served as the Signals Intelligence Director. She directed the Extended SIGINT Enterprise, overseeing the acquisition, production, and dissemination of foreign SIGINT to various government and military customers. Ms. Baginski also collaborated with the Executive Branch, members of the Intelligence Community, and global SIGINT partners, providing crucial information during a critical time. After her tenure at the NSA, she accepted a senior position at the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
